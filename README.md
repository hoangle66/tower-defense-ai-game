# 🛡️ Tower Defense AI Game

A simple Tower Defense game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, developed with the help of ChatGPT for my CS 4540 "AI Coding Assistant" project.

Enemies follow a fixed path, and the player can click on grid squares to place towers that automatically shoot small black bullets. Each enemy has health and takes multiple hits to defeat. Waves increase in difficulty, and the game ends if too many enemies reach the end!
